    During your wallet's creation process, you will receive a series of 24 words known as a seed phrase. This seed phrase essentially serves as the private key for your wallet. With this seed phrase, you can restore your private keys, transaction history, and balances using any ExchangeCoin wallet on any computer.

    This implies that anyone with knowledge of your seed can restore your private keys, transaction history, and balances to an ExchangeCoin wallet on their computer without your consent. Therefore, safeguarding your seed phrase is crucial. Treat this seed as you would a physical key to a safe. Losing your seed phrase results in permanent loss of access to your wallet and its funds. Neither you nor the ExchangeCoin developers can recover it. It is advisable to write your seed phrase on paper and store it securely. If you opt to keep it on your computer, store it in an encrypted document (do not forget the password) to protect against theft of the file or your computer.

    Each seed phrase is also linked to a 64-character seed hex. The seed hex operates similarly to the seed phrase, so securing your seed hex is equally important.

    NEVER SHARE YOUR SEED OR THE ASSOCIATED HEX KEY WITH ANYONE, INCLUDING EXCHANGECOIN DEVELOPERS!
