    For detailed instructions, read about [Verifying Binaries](../../advanced/verifying-binaries.md).

    You will need to visit the [Release Binaries](https://github.com/EXCCoin/excc-binaries/releases) page to download the manifest and manifest signature:

    `exilibrium-v{{ exilibriumversion }}-manifest.txt.asc`
