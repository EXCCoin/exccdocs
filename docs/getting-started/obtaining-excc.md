## Mine for ExchangeCoin (PoW)

Proof-of-Work (PoW) is a consensus algorithm that employs computational power to generate and validate transactions within the blockchain, creating a secure and tamper-proof ledger. PoW mining shares similarities with the traditional Bitcoin mining process. For more in-depth information on PoW mining, please refer to our documentation [here](../mining/overview.md).

## Participate in Proof-of-Stake Voting

Proof-of-Stake (PoS) voting is a mechanism through which stakeholders can participate in the governance of the ExchangeCoin network by locking a specific amount of their EXCC tokens. In exchange for locking their tokens, they receive voting rights and a financial incentive for participating in the consensus process. To learn more about the PoS voting process, please refer to our documentation [here](../proof-of-stake/overview.md).
