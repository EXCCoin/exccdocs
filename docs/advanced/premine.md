ExchangeCoin (EXCC) has emerged as a prominent cryptocurrency, thanks to its unique hybrid consensus mechanism and ASIC-resistant properties. The total supply of ExchangeCoin stands at 32,003,133.2 EXCC, of which 8,000,000 EXCC were premined. The premined coins were allocated as follows: 6,000,000 EXCC were sold during the public sale held in 2017, while 2,000,000 EXCC were designated for bonuses and an Airdrop campaign.

Following the ICO and premine, 24,000,000 EXCC were reserved within the blockchain for GPU miners. Additionally, after a hardfork in 2018, PoS stakers were also granted access to these funds, further promoting the decentralized nature of the blockchain.

The funds raised during the ExchangeCoin ICO were strategically allocated to various facets of the project, ensuring its growth and long-term sustainability. The distribution of ICO funds was as follows:

* Product Development (30%): A substantial portion of the funds was dedicated to enhancing the core technology of ExchangeCoin, fine-tuning the hybrid consensus mechanism, and ensuring its compatibility with various mining and staking platforms.

* Reserves (25%): To maintain financial stability and cater to any unforeseen expenses, 25% of the ICO funds were set aside as reserves.

* Marketing and Legal (20%): A significant portion of the funds was allocated to marketing initiatives aimed at increasing brand awareness and attracting new users, as well as addressing any legal requirements or challenges that the project might encounter.

* Operational Fund (15%): A portion of the funds was assigned to support the day-to-day operations of the project, such as staffing, infrastructure, and other necessary resources.

* Research and Development (10%): The remaining funds were invested in research and development, ensuring that ExchangeCoin remains at the forefront of innovation within the rapidly-evolving cryptocurrency landscape.

The ExchangeCoin ICO and premine successfully laid the groundwork for the project's growth, providing the necessary resources to develop its unique blockchain technology and foster a strong, decentralized mining and staking community.
