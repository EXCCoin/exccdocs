# ExchangeCoin Mining with LolMiner

---

The innovative collaboration between ExchangeCoin (EXCC) and LolMiner has paved the way for a seamless and effective mining experience. This partnership enables you to mine EXCC on your local computer using a graphics card with a minimum of 4GB RAM, thanks to the Equihash 144,5 algorithm employed by ExchangeCoin.

To commence mining EXCC on your graphics card, follow these simple steps:

* Download the [lolMiner](https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/releases) software for your preferred operating system: Windows or Linux.
* Extract the lolMiner archive on your computer.
* Modify the run_miner.bat file by entering the command line below. Remember to replace "EXCC_ADDRESS" with your EXCC address and "WORKER_NAME" with a custom identifier:

    ```
    lolMiner --coin EXCC --pool 65.109.139.153 --port 3052 --user EXCC_ADDRESS.WORKER_NAME
    ```

* Execute the run_miner.bat file to begin mining.
